;This is a conglomeration of Marathon protocols, derived from what used to

;This is the policy interface.  We have both constant and composite 
;(or time/event variant) policies. This interface is used to implement a common 
;design pattern, the composite pattern. Basically, the old TimeStep_Policy 
;elements are considered to be atomic implementations of this interface.

;They provide the building blocks of more complex, or composite, policies.  
;On their own, they never actually change, and are oblivious to time or events.

;Conversely, composite policies implement the interface differently, and provide
;some extra methods to deal with the possibility of time-driven, or event-driven 
;policy changes. We care about this because there will be event-driven policy 
;changes via a surge.
    
;Composite policies allow us to easily implement a "policy schedule" without 
;having it look any different from a normal policy.  In effect, units subscribe 
;to a unique policy, and the policy implementation takes care of the rest.
;    When an "internal" policy change or variation takes place, the composite 
;    policy will be responsible for updating the unit.  It performs this update 
;    via telling the unit to change policies from the active policy to the next 
;    scheduled policy.  This is all done via atomic policy operations. It then 
;    resets the unit's policy pointer to itself.

;Policy is = a state transition graph, the sequence of Positions a unit will cycle through

;employed, by a parameterized function.

;Note ---->
;Deployability is no longer just a function of Position....it's also a function of
;cycle time....this is based on an outdated assumption that a units availability would be associated with
;its Position.  We could validate this assumption by creating more Positions....this is simple enough, although
;it creates additional complexity.  On the other hand, when a unit changes Positions, we can check to see if
;it will become available during the course of waiting at the next Position.  If so, we have the unit
;behavior request an update for the unit at the specified avaiable time.
;TOM Change 21 Mar 2011 -> I am going to adopt the convention that any Position with the substring "_Deployable"
;is a valid deployment point.  We can use this to perform constant-time lookup to determine if a policy
;allows a unit to deploy from a Position.
;Consequently, deployability is driven ENTIRELY by the parameters for min deployable and max deployable.
;When we assert, via the policy manager, a minimum deployable time and a maximum deployable time, we will
;alter the structure of the Positiongraph to add additional nodes.
;    Essentially, we add 2 new nodes -> StartDeployable and StopDeployable
;We can add ANY Number of these nodes, by subverting existing nodes in the graph.  This is great, because it
;allows us to potentially have highly variable, and dynamic policies.  Rather than a general window of deployable,
;we could have multiple pockets of deployability.  Who knows.
;To determine if a Position is deployable, we just do a DFS from the policystart to the currentPosition.
;We then parse the resulting path (from the last Position), to determine the deployable state.  Simple.
