;;Cleanup - WORK IN PROGRESS
;;==========================

;;The original implementation of the entitystore
;;originated in a parallel, experimental build of a lightweight
;;simulation.  Much of the functionality that now resides in
;;spork.entitystore and marathon.ces.core was colocated with this
;;namespace (hence the entity definitions, event "notifications"
;;and other auxillary functions).

;;As I've migrated generic things out into spork, and integrated
;;the basic entity store into the overarching simulation infrastructure,
;;we're left with relatively little here.  Technically, we don't need
;;special entitystore implementation, we could use the barebones from
;;spork.entitysystem.store in theory.

;;We're also still using legacy entity definitions in other "data"
;;namespaces.  Since the entity store will happily accept records
;;as entities (infering keys map to components) this is no problem
;;and allows a smooth migration to useing the entity store API
;;for operating on our simstate.

;;I'll leave the entity definitions in place for now, although they
;;are not technically in use.

;;Additionally pruning to follow....

;;The only functions we "actually" use here are ->store to
;;create the entity store....


;;Pending DEPRECATION
;;===================
;;Originally a simple API to process the act of handling
;;"events" in an entity store-based simulation.  Supplanted
;;by the functionality in spork.sim.simcontext.

;;Basically, we'll perform all of our processing
;;and allocations, then drop anything that's considered
;;ephemeral.  Typically, we'll have multiple changes
;;occuring over the same time instant, but spanning
;;multiple event or update-instants.  We only care
;;about the initial and the final value.

;;Description
;;===========
;;simstate is a consolidation of all the simulation state required for Marathon 
;;to do its thing.  Each of these bits used to be part of a hierarchical object 
;;model with parent-child relationships, where each child manager could get at 
;;the state for another child via its parent, the simulation Engine.  This worked
;;okay in the beginning, and fit with some naive object oriented programming 
;;notions, but ended up leading to coupling and some other phenomena. As a result
;;I've re-organized the code base to conform to a more functional-programming 
;;paradigm: specifically, data is maintained separate from functionality, rather 
;;than classic OOP where data is encapsulated and bundled with 
;;methods/properties.  The result is a simplification of the data model, as well
;;as functions that can produce and consume bits of data necessary for the 
;;simulation.  This simstate object really just gathers all the data in one 
;;place, so that functions that need to access multiple components of data
;;simultaneously CAN.  Since it's a record, and most of the elements are also 
;;records, we get the benefit of using clojure's associative map functions and 
;;sequence libraries to access and modify our state, rather than having to deal
;;with a special set of one-off functions.

;;Since simstate implements entity store, it can be used as the :state key of
;;a simcontext, and simcontext will forward all entity-store-related implementation
;;calls to it.  This gives us a fairly flexible way to manage our simulation context,
;;specifically the entity state: use the spork.entitysystem.store API to query
;;and update the simcontext directly.  marathon.ces.core is full of idioms that
;;do this very thing, although many namespaces will use the spork.entitysystem.store
;;directly.
