;;Multimethods for Emitting Frames and Saving them to Output
;;==========================================================
;;Given a source of emitted frames, we can
;;record the frames to an output file...
(defmulti init-frame-saver (fn [t path & {:keys [field-order]}] t))

;;Immediate, i.e. frame-by-frame outputs.
;;This is more efficient than our initial hack at
;;traversing the entire history for each output.
;;This way, we support incremental outputs built
;;over time.
(defmulti emit-frame (fn [t frm] t))

;;Implementations follow later...


;;Canonical Sampling Functions
;;============================

;;These samplers transform a stream of
;;history into a stream of sampled output.
;;We typically have a set of canonical outputs
;;we expect for post-processing.  This lets us
;;define them using higher-level sequence functions
;;so we can define sampling based on the "history"
;;rather than imperatively logging and myopically
;;processing.

;;It'd be nice to define a channel-based version of this so that
;;we can compute samples state by state...
;;at any given point in time, we have n samples we're collecting.
;;as we transition through the state stream, we run each sampler
;;to see if it computes a sample.

;;Some samples are event-based...
;;like dwell-before deployment stats...

;;Can we just append a deployment record?
;;dumb sampler...probably migrate this to
;;use spork.trends sampling.
