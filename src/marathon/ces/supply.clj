;;#Supply Updating
;;The supply simulation has many concurrent process - unit simulations - 
;;that are in various states of motion.  For efficiency, we treat these 
;;processes as relatively independent, with the exception of periodic 
;;synchronization via updating.  The supply system updates either specific 
;;entities, or all entities, by evaluating the passage of time relative to the 
;;entity.  Certain functionality, such as sampling and logging, may require 
;;the entire supply to be synchronized, and thus updated to a common point in 
;;time.  For the most part, the supply will proceed eventfully, with each 
;;process updating on an as-needed basis.

;;__TODO__ move up-to-date? to the simcontext library.
;;This is a pretty general function, we can probably elevate to the core or to
;;sim context.

;;#Tracking Follow-On Supply

;;#Alteration 
;;I'm changing the existing scheme of storing followon unit
;;information, as well as non-followon, or generic unit information.
;;One (still) tempting idea is to just shove everything into tags, 
;;and use the tag annotation to execute queries.  We're heading
;;towards components at that point (which IS the right direction).
;;For now, a bridging strategy is to unify the buckets and followons, 
;;basically making a standard bucket, :default, and having everything
;;else be inferred as "non-generic" (currently meaning followon, or 
;;associated with some demand group).
;;Note# 
;;There is a general relation here...the fact is that the unit is
;;related to some element of demand...either the demandgroup, or
;;something else.  That makes tags an interesting prospect....
;;Further, if we shift to using tags to denote relationship facts, 
;;we get a consistent API, an option for batched mutable updates, and 
;;other features.  We have more facts associated with a unit than
;;merely its followon status....right now we're tracking lots of extra
;;state when it's simpler to just use tags....
