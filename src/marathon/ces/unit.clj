;;environment, and handle it all...
;;So, we could pass the unit, the message, and context into the behavior
;;function.  Wrap the crap here...

;;when the unit's last-update is not consistent with the

;;when units are out of sync and actions that depend on
;;accumulated statistics pop up, in particular, ordering
;;units for consideration in filling demand.

;;Since dwell is the primary arbiter, and we can compute
;;dwell as a function of cycletime, we can establish a
;;quick projection of normalized dwell relative to the
;;time elapsed since last-update.  If we add a component
;;that indicates last-look, rather than last-update,
;;we can have a simple means of projecting statistics like
;;cycletime and dwell, without having to update the whole
;;unit.

;;We now have a component, :dt, which tells us if any
;;time has elapsed for the unit entity.  :dt comes to
;;us when we use ces.core/current-entity.
