;;##Filling
;;A collection of functions that define the process of mapping classes of demand
;;to eligible supply, and filling demand with suitable supply.  The fill system
;;acts as a service for the engine, and provides operations used - primarily - 
;;by the demand simulation.  The process of filling pushes changes on the 
;;supply, since the act of filling usually consumes some resources in supply and
;;motivates a kind of motion in the supply simulation.

;;Note: This is one of the more involved pieces of documentation, and could 
;;benefit from refinement.  However, filling has proven to be
;;a sensitive subject, so the extra layer of commentary is still useful.

;##Decomposing the Fill Process....
;Sourcing a demand is really the composition of three simpler tasks: 
;find-supply, take n items from the supply, fill the demand with the n items.
;The following text dissects each of these compenents into atomic, composable 
;elements, and defines the higher-order demand-filling behavior from the
;primitive elements.  Before that, we take a brief detour through history to 
;examine the original object-based mechanisms for the fill process, and how 
;they remain in their functional counterparts.

;##Understanding the Legacy Implemention of Fill Functions
;The legacy notion of a fill-function is central to the idea of finding an 
;ordered set of candidate supply. In the old object model, the fill-function was
;effectively a partially-applied function that closed over a fillgraph and a 
;supplygenerator.  Since we only had one type of supply generator, the supply 
;generator was really just a function that used the fill graph to provide an 
;ordered list of supply on demand, where the fill graph is a set of relations 
;between elements of supply and elements of demand envisioned as a directed 
;acyclic graph.

;#Legacy Filling Via the FillFunction Object
;The FillFunction used to be an object that provided a high-level interface for 
;querying a set of rules about feasible and desired relations between elements
;of supply & demand, aka. Fill Rules, along with a candidate supply of
;units, provided a prioritized sequence of units that can fill said
;demand.  Fill Rules were embodied in a Directed Acyclic Graph,
;known as the FillGraph, the topology of which encoded weighted paths
;from demand sinks to sources of supply.  These abstractions were necessary,
;because the concept of priority is highly variable (even time/event dependent),
;and may change from study to study or run to run.  Hence, the desire to make 
;the rules and semantics for filling supply highly variable and data-driven.
;In the modern functional variant, we still have the notion of a fill-function, 
;but it does not perform the same amount of "heavy lifting" the old object did.
;In fact, the fill-function is really a simple chunk of data that contains the 
;contextual rules for filling any demand.  It is used in explicit queries, vs. 
;containing a query method relative to a fillfunction object.
;
;#Fill Rules and The Fill Graph
;FillRules, encoded in a FillGraph, actually tell us a lot before we simulate.
;The FillGraph is generated, as a pre-process step, by analyzing the supply 
;entity records, the demand entity records, and the relation records for 
;Marathon.  Each source provides a unique element of the graph: supply populates
;the graph with source nodes, or terminal nodes that can supply units of a 
;specific type (usually encoded as an SRC).  Demand populates sink nodes of 
;Demand on the graph, which consume units of a specific type.  Relations add 
;nodes to the interior region between source and sink nodes, creating new paths 
;(via substitution and equivilancies), which further relate supply and demand.  
;Together, each dataset is parsed to derive a set of rules, which form the
;topology (or connections) of the graph.  We can then bash the graph with some
;useful algorithms that make it easy to search, scope out useless rules, and
;even do some error checking. Unlike the fill-function, the fill graph maintains
;its structure and uses from the legacy version, since it was pure data then as
;well.

;When building the FillGraph, we actually create an implicit dependency graph
;that can tell us which elements of supply and demand are A) Reachable B)Not 
;Reachable. Nodes (usually coded as SRCs, but any string is valid) that are
;Reachable also provide information on how many other nodes they can reach.  
;In most cases, there will be a 1:1 match between a source node, say a Supply 
;of SRC1, and a sink node, say a Demand for SRC1.  In this case, we know that 
;both Supply and Demand contain SRC1, there will be a zero-cost path from 
;SINK_SRC1 -> SRC1 -> SOURCE_SRC1.  Since we allow the possibility of 
;substitutions in our ruleset, there may be more than 1 path from SINK_SRC1, 
;maybe to another source of substitutible supply like SRC2 
;(SINK_SRC1->SRC1_SRC2->SOURCE_SRC2).
;In this scenario, supply for both SRC1 and SRC2 are related, in that there's a 
;dependency introduced by the fill rules.  At a minumum, any simulation for SRC1
;must include SRC2, even if there's no demand for SRC2, because SRC2 "may" serve
;as supply for SRC1.  In this case, the set #{SRC1 SRC2} can be said to form an 
;equivalence class, or they form a strongly connected component.

;#Ancillary Pre-Processing Via the FillGraph
;While strictly related to the higher-level notion of filling demands, we can 
;exploit properties of the fillgraph - during a pre-processing phase - to make 
;searching the fillgraph more efficient, identify possible problems with the 
;data, and identify possible areas for exploting data-parallelism.  

;#Islands Denote Possible Data Errors
;In the case where there is NO path from either supply or demand, we have 
;"islands", or nodes that are unreachable (class B from the paragraph above).  
;These islands are usually the result of data errors, and indicate missing 
;supply (in the case of unfillable demand), missing demand (in the case of 
;unusable supply), or missing relations (in either case). Pre-processing will 
;automatically find islands, and all equivalence classes / strongly connected
;components in the FillGraph.

;#PreProcessing Identifies Independent Data and Simplifies The Fill Graph
;One of the benefits of finding equivalence classes is that we can choose to 
;only simulate SRCs that are dependent. This lets us reduce the amount of work 
;into independent batches and divide the simulation into N smaller simulation 
;runs. This can provide a big cost savings for certain analyses by reducing the 
;total number of events and entity updates that must be processed, and 
;independent simulations can be computed in parallel.  Finally, pre-processing 
;the FillGraph actually reduces the complex web of interior nodes, and provides
;a simplified graph that is very quick to search due to every path in the 
;reduced graph having, at most, 2 steps from unfilled to filled.

;##Default Implementation for Querying Rules to Find the Most Suitable Supply
;The default scheme for prioritizing supply is to query the ruleset to
;find an ordered set of matches between sets, or buckets, of supply and the
;demand in need of filling.  Due to substitution and other criteria, the buckets
;of supply may be of lower "cost" to utilize for the demand than others.  This 
;corresponds to a weighted path in the FillGraph.  The query is essentially a 
;variation of the K-shortest paths algorithm, where the shortest path is found, 
;then the next, ... as needed.  These paths describe a context, or a 
;justification for selecting a sub set of supply, and serve to classify the 
;entire subset of supply as a certain class, with a uniform priority.  This is
;desirable, as it effectively partitions the search space and provides an 
;efficient means of selecting sets of units for possible deployment.    

;;When time permits, I intend to take this to the next logical step and just
;;implement a min-cost max-flow fill algorithm instead of the k shortest   
;;paths.

;;#Fill Rule Interpretation
;;Given a common description of a demand category, the fill function should be 
;;able to interpret the demand rule into a corresponding supply rule.  After
;;converting to a common supply rule, different fill functions may interpret 
;;the same rule in completely different manners, or we can have a robust 
;;language for describing and interpreting rules.  The end result should be a 
;;way to map classes of demand to ordered sets of supply in a general and 
;;flexible fashion.

;;In the legacy implementation, the rule structure is actually embedded in the 
;;topology of a directed graph.  Labelled 'sink nodes' on the graph represent 
;;possible demand categories, while primitive 'source nodes' are primitive 
;;elements of supply.  Complex rules for substitution and equivalence are 
;;encoded in the intermediate arcs of the graph.  These functions help interpret
;;to and from the graph encoding in the legacy implementation.

;;Standard labels for defining source and sink rules.  Maybe memoize these.
(def sink-label   (memoize (fn [x] (fg/sink-label x))))
(def source-label (memoize (fn [x] (fg/source-label x))))


;;Dispatch function for reading demands as demand rules.

;;category for demand d is to see if the demandgroup for d is
;;present in the set of groups provided in [src groups].  If so,
;;we return d's demandgroup.  This is an implementation specific
;;to followon (and later SRM) demands, in that we want to define
;;a narrow, non-default set of supply to look at, which is associated
;;explicitly by some key (typically but not exclusively :demandgroup).
;;It's basically a re-routing or alternate projection of the supply
;;for querying ("where"), which allows unique considerations of
;;"feasible" supply when filling, and allows highly variable

;;  - If the proposed category is "restricted", where it exists in

;;    which must be drawn from units in said "restricted"
;;    category, vs. a potentially wider swath of categories (to include
;;    the :default).  We implemented this interpretation to express
;;    deviations from the normal order of fill, such as NonBOG.

;;TOM Notes 5 Aug 2019
;;We have a decent framework for expressing supply constraints,
;;computed supply, preferences, and substitutions.  What we
;;lack is a clear mapping of :demand/category to
;;applicable filters.  "Right now" we had Rotational, SRM,
;;NonBOG, and variants of NonBOG (RC-Only).

;;What we'd like is a simple extension that tracks the
;;filters associated Categories.  Since SourceFirst
;;defines order-by, Categories define both filters AND
;;additional computed supply.  Computed supply has its
;;own implicit filters (per legacy implementation).

;;The ideal end-state is to have these concepts unified
;;and expressed via  simple data model (e.g. the current
;;map-based structure) that is then associated with the
;;high-level rules denoted by simple strings, as well
;;as having a more expressive DSL encoded as EDN
;;vectors and maps to allow inline forms to define
;;said criterion.

;;For now, we simply extend the projection of
;;demand->rule to include a static set of
;;mappings from Category->Filter.
;;This is the simple, dumb way to implementat
;;said functionality, but it also makes it
;;easy to extend in the aforementioned
;;direction in the future.

;;##Finding and Ordering Supply  

;#Legacy Means For Generating A Stream of Deployable Supply
;In the legacy implementation,  a SupplyGenerator object served as a poor man's 
;version of a sequence abstraction (or an iterator in other languages).  It used
;internal state, combined with a reference to one or more buckets of supply, to
;walk the shortest possible paths defined by an external query, visiting each
;set of supply and stitching together what appeared to be a single sequence of 
;units.  The abstract sequence of units returned by the generator was thus an 
;ordered traversal of the supply, as dictated by the fillgraph.

;The SupplyGenerator also used a secondary prioritization function to determine
;the order for each subsequence of units it found. When the generator visited 
;each "bucket" of supply, it used a prioritization function to sort the bucket, 
;then collated the ordered subsequence of units into an abstract 
;"total ordering" of all supply, using fairly complex and dynamic prioritization
;rules and supply->demand relationships.  Thankfully, the underlying traversal 
;and ordering mechanism was hidden behind a simple stream-like API, which 
;facilitated higher-order expressions like "take" and "next" to allow consumers
;to view the SupplyGenerator as a sequence of units.

;#Default Unit Comparison
;To deal with highly variable supply ordering rules, the SupplyGenerator had a 
;modular unit prioritization object (a UnitComparer) for establishing the 
;fine-grained ordering of subsequences of units.  The default UnitComparer 
;prioritization was (and remains) based on a Unit's absolute position in its 
;current rotational policy.  This position, or policy coordinate, is a value 
;between [0.0 1.0]. The policy coordinate is computed by comparing the unit's 
;time in the current cycle, with the expected length of the cycle, or 
;CycleTime / CycleLength, where CycleTime <= CycleLength.  Computing the policy 
;coordinate provides a normalized representation of each unit's "progress" in 
;its lifecycle.  Since typical rotational policies indicate a positive relation 
;between cycle time and readiness, the proportional representation of the policy
;coordinate provides a convenient measure of readiness as well.
;
;__Note__ , this assumption holds for known rotational policies, but may fail if 
;readiness is not a function of time in cycle.  Also, other unit prioritization 
;functions exist, including preferences by component (either AC or RC first).  
;In the end, notions of prioritization are highly context sensitive, depending 
;on the goals of the study.  They are designed to be modular, easily changed,
;composed, and selectively applied.

;##Default Legacy Total Ordering of Supply
;The default notion of ordering used in the legacy object model will remain the 
;default in the functional programming version, with ostensibly identical 
;mechanisms (minus the reliance on objects and mutable state).
;Using the policy coordinate as a comparator, the FillFunction orders each 
;subset of units so that their policy coordinate, and thus readiness, is sorted
;in descending order.    
;Thus, the total ordering is a sorting of units by Min Path Length, then Max 
;policy coordinate.  This provides a natural ordering that corresponds with 
;rotational policy, in that units, regardless of component, are drawn evenly 
;according to relative readiness, starting with units that directly match the
;capability demanded, and that have had the most time to increase readiness 
;(most capable, most ready), ending with units that least match the capability 
;demanded, with the least amount of time to increase readiness (least capable,  
;least ready). When units deploy, the context of the fill path is annotated on 
;their deployment record, in addition to other stats such as path length.  

;#Effectful Filling Under the Legacy FillFunction
;Under the legacy FillFunction object, we typically prepped it with a query, 
;which loaded the supply generator (providing a total ordering of eligible 
;supply), and applied the "take" method of the FillFunction to a numeric 
;argument.  The result of "taking" 10 items, for example, would provide a 
;collection - implicitly the 10 (or less) most "suitable" elements of supply, 
;represented by a collection of FillData objects.    

;Some forms of fill could cause the creation of just-in-time units, or Ghosts,
;which caused the side-effect of actually creating supply upon generation 
;(inside the SupplyGenerator). Going forward in the functional design, we make 
;such side effects explicit data that must be interpreted and evaluated, rather
;than using hidden mutation.  

;With a valid, prioritized order of units in hand, the FillFunction tried to 
;fill the demand by selecting units in order until demand is filled, or no more
;units exist.  Completely filling a demand would trigger additional effects.  
;Under the functional version, we maintain the spirit of these features - i.e. 
;the communication of success or failure to fill - but again, we use explicit 
;data structures to communicate effects.

;##Legacy (Mutable Object-Based) Fill Summary
;All the fill function did was wrap both the fill graph and a mutable generator, 
;where the generator served as a live "cursor" to buckets or partitions of 
;supply.  This was effectively a poor man's inelegant version of a stream.
;It provided an interface to initialize queries and maintain state.  Since we 
;were pulling from multiple "buckets" of supply, according to an ordering 
;dictated by shortest paths in the fillgraph, we had the "generator" 
;automatically pointing at multiple buckets

;##Filling Functionally
;Under the new functional design, the fill-function is a chunk of data that 
;contains the rules necessary for ordering a set of units relative to a demand. 
;When combined with a query function, the data in the fill-function will 
;inform the ordering of any supply relative to any demand, and provide an 
;ordered lazy sequence of candidates. This eliminates the complexity from have 
;multiple mutable buckets to draw from in the legacy verison.  Now, we simply 
;have an abstract "sequence" of candidates to draw from while we fill.  The 
;function that generates said sequence, __query__, may be very complex, but it

;;The protocol ISupplier provides an abstraction for systems that can interpret

;;language for describing fill rules, which should facilitate communication 
;;between a party asking for supply, and the supplier who can provide it.  This 
;;should allow for a very flexible arrange of rule descriptions, as well as
;;varying degrees of interpretation rule interpretation, and the generation of 
;;promised supply.

;;__TODO__ Provide a default implementation of the ISupplier that can parse

;;__TODO__ Provide a set of extended Supplier definitions, possibly combinators
;;for compound supply rules, that allow users to easily define prioritization 
;;and possible supply generation criteria.  For instance, we need a way to

;;##High Level Fill 

;#It's all about finding supply.
;The ultimate purpose of querying a fill-function is to answer a simple query:  
;Given a demand (or a rule that describes the demand), and a supplystore
;(which contains supply), which elements of supply are are most suitable to fill 
;the demand, based on the interpretation of the fill-function?

;#First: "Find the most suitable supply".
;This represents an ordered sequence of candidate fills....we may not, in fact,
;utilize every candidate.  A better description is that __find-supply__ provides
;a list of  fill-promises, which are realized as needed.  A fill-promise is a 
;function that consumes the current context and returns a pair of 
;[promised-unit, new-context].  That way we can update the context by realizing
;the fill-promise (i.e. applying it against a context we thread through), and 
;then do something with the unit that was promised.  Since these are just 
;promises, i.e. potential supply, we don't mutate anything or make any changes
;to the context until we need to.  

;find-supply::(rule->demand->demandgroup->name->supply->phase->[fill-promise])  
;             ->supply->rule->[fill-promise]  
;where fill-promise::(simcontext->'a->[filldata,simcontext])  


;;Note: filldata == {:keys [rule fillPath pathlength followon source]}
;;simple....
;;TODO# replace with record or type.
;;BUGFIX: we strip out the :dt here if necessary.
(defn unit->filldata [cat src length u]
  ;;we're out of position here..
  ;;rule ;fillPath ;pathLength
  (->> (dissoc u :dt)
       (filldata/->fill  cat src length
          (if (or (:followon u)
                  (= (:state u) :followon))
            "TRUE" "FALSE"))))

;;all we expect from fills is that there is a quantity
;;if there is a key for :actions, then we have some requirement.
;;otherwise, it's a default fill, we just do what's necessary to
;;deploy the unit.


;;Do we need unit->filldata?  Maybe for future supply....i.e.
;;intended fills.  Dunno.  It's okay to go greedy atm...
;;Note: we can retroactively go back in time (using imm data)
;;and update the unit's status (i.e. require it to go to mob/demob,
;;ctc training, change it's state, etc....this makes us rewind
;;the simulation though, invalidating any currently rendered
;;state.  Generalizes into searching though...which may be useful.

(defn find-supply
  "Returns an ordered sequence of actions that can result in supply.
   This effectively applies the suitability function related to fillfunc to the 
   rule, the demand, and the supply.  The result is a sequence of 
   potential fills....where potential fills are data structures that contain 
   the context of the fill (i.e. the unit, the actions required to realize the 
   fill, and other meta data), typically a filldata record."

     (map (fn [[[cat src length] u]] 
            (unit->filldata cat src length u))
          (query/match-supply rule supplystore))))

;;TODO# fillPath in our supply query is currently pretty rudimentary.
;;It may be nice, for feature parity, to have then entire fillpath
;;relayed rather than the endpoint.



;;An element of supply has a quantity associated with it.
;;It also has a set of actions associated with delivering said supply.

;;A supplier provides units at the cost of updates...
;;A supplier can provide 1 or more (possibly infinite) units.
;;Suppliers may nest inside each other (i.e. a unit living inside
;;another).

;We can coerce our list of fill promises into actual fills by applying 
;__realize-fill__ to them.  Assuming a fill promise consumes a context, we  
;apply the promise to a given context.  This should produce a pair of the 
;filldata --information about the unit realized for filling-- and an updated 
;simulation context.
;;Note: we need to alter this...I understand the reason it exists, namely
;;to allow for things like supply-generation in the face of constraints,
;;but we're losing information from the filldata as a consequence.
;;we get a fill-promise :: marathon.fill.filldata, and
;;we project it onto :: [marathon.supply.unitdata ctx]
(defn realize-fill
  "Applies the a function, fill-promise, that maps a context to a pair of 
   [filldata, updated-context].  The updated-context should represent the result
   of realizing the promised fill."

   (if-let [actions (get fill-promise :actions)]
     (actions ctx) ;;perform any actions necessary 
     ctx)])
    
;#Second: Allocate a candidate fill against a demand.
;Assuming we have a candidate fill, and a demand that needs filling, we define
;the consequences of using the candidate (via some filldata) to logically "fill"
;the demand.  The result is a new context, since there may be additional 
;consequences to the context due to a fill.

;While the demand is assumed to have inspired the list of candidates, it's 
;not consequential for allocation purposes.  In fact, the list of candidates 
;could be completely random or drawn in an otherwise arbitrary fashion.
;__Note__ that would make a great _test_, having a random fill function.  

;Assuming we have a chunk of realized filldata, we define a way to apply it to 
;a demand to accomplish any updates necessary for filling.  This is a primitive
;function that will support the higher-order notion of "filling" a demand.  
;__apply-fill__ should represent the new context emerging from applying a 
;realized fill, in the form of filldata, to a demand.  

;Originally, this meant that fills would always result in a deployment at the
;end.  By elevating apply-fill into the API, we can actually implement things 
;that would otherwise be difficult, i.e. delayed fills (pre-allocating units 
;and scheduling them to deploy at a later date, while nominally "filling" the 
;demand).

;;The atomic fill process rests inside a high-level function, __fill-demand__ .

;;shuffling that is necessary behind a simple, high-level interface amenable to 
;;use in a reduction ala __clojure.core/reduce__ .  

;;The end result is a new context, representing the consequences of filling said 
;;demand with the promised fill.  Under this scheme, __apply-fill__ will 
;;automatically handle the realization of a fill-promise, and thread its updated
;;context through the process of deploying the unit associated with the realized 
;;filldata.  Since fill-promises are typically for single elements of supply,  
;;__fill-demand__ will typically only apply a single unit towards a demand.

;;#Trying to Completely Satisfy a Demand

;Since we know how to effectively apply promised fills towards demands via 
;__fill-demand__ in an atomic fashion, we can define the notion of completely 
;filling a demand as finding the supply for the demand, using __fill-demand__ on 
;each candidate element of supply, and drawing from the supply until either the
;demand is filled, or the candidates are exhausted.  

;1. Assumes candidate preference is invariant.  There may be a time when we need
;   to re-evaluate the ordering of candidates while we're filling, i.e. the 
;   amount of fill may impact the order of candidates.  For now, we assume that 
;   the ordering of candidates is independent of the demand fill.
