;;The functions in this library focus on quickly deriving policies from existing templates.  There are a
;;multitude of hard-coded templates in here that describe canonical policies, which are used in
;;the PolicyCreation module to easily derive new policies from the template.  This is more or less a
;;policy library.  Note, all of these policies, as of 12 Sep 2012, have been documented in a serialized
;;format.  Technically, the use of policy templates does not require VBA code, and will be pushed outside
;;of VBA or the host platform in the near future.  By exposing the templates as data, it makes it easier
;;to add new templates to the library, which end users can stitch together and derive from.  Additionally,
;;pushing the specification outside of VBA should allow for specialized, graphical tools to build policies,
;;which are then imported into Marathon during pre-processing.

;;We end up needing to vary policies (that is the scheduled state

;;which the users could parametrically alter via a simple table of

;;stacked policies and policies mapped to periods of time. 

;;We still provide that functionality here, but in a much more refined

;;define a set of macros that provide legacy policy templates,
;;allowing users to compose them in aforementioned ways.  However,
