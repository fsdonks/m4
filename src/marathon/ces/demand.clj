;;provide mutable references for processing "inside" the transaction.
;;This is like STM....transactions expect to have access to 
;;resources so they can do their jobs.  So we can provide a 
;;transactional context, to decouple the "storage" of stuff from 
;;the processing of stuff.  This is close to how the entity system 
;;decouples component data from how that data is operated on in 
;;systems.

;;In an ideal world, we'd really just love to have a flat map of 
;;resources, or bindings, that form the local transactional context.
;;Given that, we can drastically simplify the operations...i.e. 
;;a transactional function operates on a map and returns a map.
;;What can transactions do? 
;;  Some times we want to add resources to the transaction, i.e.
;;  establish a handle to them for bulk-loading or more efficient 
;;  processing (via mutation).  Maybe we just don't want to pay 
;;  the lookup cost over and over again.  
;;  These resources should be shared within a transaction....;
;;  In other words, we allow transactions to a) bind resources 
;;  to the transactional context, b) fetch resources from 
;;  the transactional context, and c) commit resources to the 
;;  transactional context. 

;;  Under this paradigm, we spend time defining "where" resources 
;;  are, and "how" to acquire them -> the current example is 
;;  using the cells methodolgy to establish resource paths in 
;;  nested maps.  This is a clean divide between acquiring and 
;;  freeing resources...

;;  Transactions can "assume" they have access to everything 
;;  they need, along with facilities for altering the transactional 
;;  context.  When this assumption is violated, we can bomb out 
;;  with an error.  This is akin to a transactional contract.

;;#simple contract, but gets us away from simple, focused computation.
;;  Thus, transactional functions operate without any consideration 
;;  of how the resources are managed.  They retain the pure functional
;;  aspect of the current design.  We know what the "input" contract
;;  is explicitly:  transactional functions request specific resources 
;;  from the context, and if those do not exist, they bomb.

;;  What about the output contract?  What should a transactional 
;;  function "return"?  Perhaps a sequence of effects, if any?  
;;  At the very least, it needs to return the transactional 
;;  context.  This lets us define a monadic setting for operating 
;;  on this stuff.  It also keeps the interface uniform, akin to 
;;  the state monad.  Transactors take a context, and other args, 
;;  and return the context.  This is pretty consistent with the 
;;  majority of our functions that operate on simstate, but 
;;  small auxillary functions are - currently - at a loss.
;;  The aux functions like those in sim.demand, expect to 
;;  operate on demandstore's for the most part, or policystores.
;;  We can (and do) pack that into the transactional context.
;;  However,

;;Unfilled demands exist in a priority queue, UnfilledQ, ordered by the demand's 
;;priority field value - typically an absolute, static ordering, set at 
;;construction.  
;;UnfilledQ partitions the set of active demands that are unfilled.
;;When we go to look for demands that need filling, we traverse keys in 
;;priority order.  
;;We use a priority queue to effeciently respond to changes in a demand's fill 
;;status, and to only try to fill demands when we need to.  Older algorithms 
;;naively polled the demands, and led to quadratic complexity.  In this case, 
;;the priority queue lets us implement a push algorithm, and if we're filling 
;;hierarchically, we can terminate the fill process early if we fail to satisfy
;;a demand.  
 
;;Basic demand events are Activation, Deactivation, Fill, Unfill.
;;Activation and unfill events manifest in demandnames being added to the 
;;unfilledQ. Deactivation and filled events manifest in demandnames being 
;;removed from the unfilledQ. We want to effeciently find out if 
;;there are unfilled demands,  what the most important unfilled demand is, 
;;and what happens when we fill the demand (take the demand off the q or not?)
;;Using the fill queue, the update-fill function provides a general hub to 
;;enforce these invariants.  You'll see it get used a bit when we make changes
;;to a demand, either filling, activating, etc.  It applies the appropriate 
;;processing to keep a demand's fill status consistent.

;;##Describing Categories of Demand To Inform Demand Fill Rules
;;Demands have typically been binned into gross categories, based on the type 
;;of capability required to meet a demand.  Additional complexities arose as
;;subcategories - such as the notion of follow-on demands - became a necessity.
;;This resulted in a multi-phase fill process: where we initially selected 
;;demands to fill based on a simple priority - supplied by the user - we quickly
;;found a set of conditional or meta priorities that required "trying to fill"
;;a class of demands - follow-on eligible demands - with supply first.  This 
;;mapped to the need to utilize pre-deployed supply to avoid incidental waste of 
;;resources, when pre-deployed supply - supply already local to the demand - 
;;could be flowed directly to compatible concurrent local demands. 
;;The need to utilize a special class of supply resulted in a duplication
;;of the fill logic, where the first "phase" tried to exhaust all follow-on 
;;supply, with the second or general phase determining demand priority under 
;;a simple priority scheme.   

;;#Categories are a Little Language for Relating Supply to Demand
;;As the potential for additional "special cases" of fill arose, it became 
;;obvious that a general mechanism for unambiguously describing cases would 
;;simplify the filling logic, and allow for future rule expansions.
;;After a lengthy thinking cycle, I resolved to define a useful little language
;;for describing categories, that is, elements of demand and the contextual 
;;information for how they should be filled.  Categories are encoded as simple 
;;clojure data structures, and interpreted by both the demand system and the 
;;supply system to affect queries.  Thus, they act as a cross-domain 
;;protocol for matching and ordering entities.

;;This should eliminate a slew of duplication and complexity from the legacy 
;;implementation, since we can use the category of fill to select eligible 
;;demands, and to inform suitability of supply.  

;;#Category Examples

;;In the simple case, when the category is a string, or a key, we act like 
;;normal filling..
;;__(fill-category "SRC2")__ 
;;=> find all eligible demands for SRC2.

;;In a complex case, when the category is a sequence, we parse it according to 
;;the following:
;;Pairs define a more constrained category, which is interpreted as a category 
;;of SRC and a grouping.  

;;__(fill-category ["SRC2" "Group1"])__ 
;;=> find the eligible demands for SRC2, where the demand group is group1.

;;If the category rule is a pair, and the second element is also a sequence, 
;;the sequence is parsed as a simple set filter.  The second element then forms
;;a union query that can incorporate multiple demand groups into the criteria.

;;__(fill-category ["SRC2" ["Group1" "Group2"]])__ 
;;=> find the eligible demands for SRC2, where the demand group is either Group1 
;;or Group2.

;;Detailed categories come in the forms of maps, which are interpreted as a 
;;category pair, and a set of filters by default.  We can use tags to create 
;;general filters as well, which should let us create a unique set of queries.
;;A trivial (and useful) extension will be to allow arbitrary tags to be 
;;included.  For instance, the map associated with the :supply-tags key in the 
;;example could result in an additional tag query to be executed against 
;;candidate supply.

;;(fill-category {:demand {:src "SRC1" :demandgroup "Group2"}    
;;                :supply-tags {:just-in-time :state-side}})  

;;Categories serve to link supply AND demand, since categories are parsed by 
;;ISupplier functions into supply ordering queries.
;;For example,  from the supply-side, we determine which supply is eligible to 
;;fill an ["SRC1" "Group2"] category of demand:  
;;By default, the query should look for supply matching "SRC1", and all feasible
;;substitutes for "SRC1", where the constraint that the supply followon code 
;;also equals "Group2".

;;Categories can be interpreted an arbitrary number of ways, but the preceding
;;conventions should cover both the 90% use cases, for simple SRC matches, and 
;;almost unlimited extensibility via encoding categories as maps, to be 
;;interpreted by an ISupplier.  This also simplifies the demand fill logic, 
;;since we can implement the same "phased" or hierarchical fill process by 
;;encoding the information in the category being filled.  The solution to the 
;;existing "follow-on" fill still provides a phased fill approach, but it uses
;;the same demand ordering function (rather than duplicating and slightly 
;;modifying).  This makes it possible to define a plethora of filling schemes
;;by either querying or building demand categories, and composing eligibilty 
;;functions in a desired order.

;;#Demand Category Methods
;;Categories are used by two new functions: __find-eligible-demands__ , 
;;defined here, and __find-supply__,  defined in marathon.sim.fill.

;;schedule their activation day and deactivation day (start + duration). During

;;a deactivation day.

;; more specifically - list the newly activated demand as unfilled.
;;   --given the demand's category, update the unfilled queue...
;;   --alternative, sort demands as needed when filling.

;;note: we have some simple component-level queries that pop out here...
;;active-demands == entities with a demand component, and an active component...
;;inactive-demands == entities with a demand component, not in active component...
;;most of the time, we only care about active...

;;unfilled-demands == active demands with an unfilled component.

;;Rather than mutating a structure in a nested object,
;;we can see activating a demand as marking the demand active,
;;and computing the requirement for the demand.
;;Note: we can update the unfilledq at each step, after activating
;;or deactivating demands...
