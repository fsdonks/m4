;;The entity factory is a port of legacy functions used to read
;;entity information from tabular sets of data according to
;;the marathon data schemas.  The factory's primary function is
;;to project records onto entities (i.e. units and demands)
;;as well as serve as a hub for registering entities and
;;scheduling things like initial starting conditions.
;;The entityfactory could probably be broken apart,
;;but it's legacy functionality would have to go somewhere.
;;For now, we'll keep it in a similar namespace, but as
;;opportunities arise, we may be able to abastract out
;;functionality.

;;*Entity Orders
;;The entity factory used to be an object that maintained
;;a reference to a parent simulation context.  This allowed
;;it to interpret data, like  a set of demand
;;records, into the act of creating demand entities,
;;notifying the simulation context that the a new demand had been
;;registered, and registering the demand with the demandstore.
;;Most of this was accomplished via side effects, so creating,
;;and loading entities, was fairly imperative and stateful.

;;Going forward, we're going to break up the distiction between
;;these responsibilities, and communicate the results via
;;EntityOrders.  An EntityOrder is merely a record that
;;the entity factory can intepret, given a context, to yield
;;a new context.  In this case, the context is our stock
;;simcontext.  Seen as an interpreter, our entityfactory
;;evalutates orders relative to the simulation context, returning
;;a new simulation context.  We define new kinds of EntityOrders
;;to allow for different types of entities to be built.

;;In the scheme of our IO processes, this means we care about
;;a lower layer of functions that read raw data - typically
;;in the form of tab delimited text, and convert that data
;;into some kind of EntityOrder that our factory can recognize.

;;Ideally, we end up with a simple interface for "Creating" entities
;;in the simulation, where entity creation may involve an arbitrarily
;;complex sequence of updates.

;;*Basic Functions
;;Many of our functions are concerned with IO, that is, reading
;;tab-delimited text records, and creating entity orders from them.

;;For now, we're using dynamic scope...
(def ^:dynamic *ctx* core/emptysim)

;;I think we may want to make the entityfactory functions operate
;;on a dynamic var.  That should make the calling code clearer...
;;There are events where we trigger notifications and such, for
;;logging purposes.  Maybe we we only check if the context is
;;actually bound, and then do something.

;;The original procedure actually mutated the context
;;as demand records were parsed.  We can decouple this step by
;;creating a sequence of entity creation actions, i.e. entity
;;orders, that can be processed into state changes.

;;For instance:

;;This is technically a bottleneck at the moment; Not terrible, but
;;we may look at more efficient ways of doing it.  It's the check for
;;duplicate demands that's slowing us; The partitioning may be done
;;more smartly, or without building two collections.
